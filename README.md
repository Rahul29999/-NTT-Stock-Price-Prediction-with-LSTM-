# NTT-Stock-Price-Prediction-with-LSTM

                         Overview of the NTT stock price project
In this Traniee project, I used NTT stock price data to build a time series forecasting model. I began with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data and its patterns, and ultimately evaluated the accuracy of the model. I applied a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict stock prices and assessed its performance to verify accuracy, aiming to apply the model in practice.
# Task Content
 # 1.	Read and analyze the Data
Overview: To begin, I created a table of contents for the analysis and imported the necessary libraries to work with the NTT stock price data. I examined the data’s statistical properties, checked for trends and seasonality over time, and identified any outliers. The goal was to uncover patterns in the data that could inform the predictive modeling process.
# 2.	Data Visualization
  Overview: I used the Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries to create various visualizations. These included a correlation heatmap to understand relationships between features, and histogram plots to analyze the distribution of the data.
# 3.	Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
Overview :I performed essential preprocessing steps like handling missing values and scaling numerical features to prepare the data for modeling. Additionally, I created new features, such as moving averages and lagged values, to capture trends and patterns in stock prices. The goal was to ensure the data was well-prepared to improve model accuracy in predicting stock prices.
# 4.	Model Selection and Training
Overview :Using LSTM models for time series forecasting is advantageous because they are designed to handle sequential data, making them ideal for ordered time series. LSTMs effectively retain information over long periods, capturing long-term dependencies that are crucial in forecasting. They also mitigate the vanishing gradient problem often faced by traditional RNNs, allowing for better learning from extended sequences. LSTMs can manage variable-length input data and integrate additional influencing factors, such as exogenous variables, enhancing forecasting accuracy. Their high performance often surpasses traditional statistical methods, and they excel at modeling complex, non-linear relationships within the data. Overall, LSTMs are a powerful choice for time series forecasting due to these capabilities.
# 5.	Evaluating the model and analyzing the results
Overview :The evaluation of various models for time series forecasting reveals notable performance differences. The Random Forest model achieved the highest R² score at 37.78%, indicating it effectively captures some variance in the data, followed by CatBoost with 33.30%. In contrast, models like AdaBoost (-2.38%), K-Nearest Neighbors (-20.73%), and SGD Regressor (an extreme negative score) performed poorly, failing to provide meaningful predictions. Overall, while Random Forest and CatBoost show promise, further refinement and exploration of other approaches, such as LSTM, may be necessary to enhance forecasting accuracy..
# 6. Conclusion
Summary : The evaluation of various models revealed that CatBoost Accuracy emerged as the best performer with an accuracy of 70.34%, closely followed by Random Forest at 69.25% and Decision Tree at 66.21%. In contrast, K-Nearest Neighbors exhibited poor performance at 50.71%, while both AdaBoost and Support Vector Machine also demonstrated weak results, with accuracies of 55.12% and 52.16%, respectively.
Regarding regression analysis, Random Forest achieved the highest R² score of 37.78%, while several models, including AdaBoost (-2.38%) and K-Nearest Neighbors (-20.73%), displayed negative R² scores, indicating a poor fit for the data.
The LSTM model demonstrated a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 2.35.
Predicting a consistent decline in stock prices over the next 30 days, starting at 180.44 and gradually decreasing to 167.76. Overall, traditional models are effective for classification tasks, while the LSTM model shows promise for time series forecasting.
