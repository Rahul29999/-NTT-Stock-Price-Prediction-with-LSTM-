# NTT-Stock-Price-Prediction-with-LSTM

                           Overview of the NTT stock price project
In this training, you will use NTT stock price data to build a time series data forecasting model. You will begin with exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the data, and ultimately evaluate the accuracy of the model. You will use machine learning to predict stock prices and verify their accuracy, aiming to apply it in practice.
# Task Content
1.	Data Understanding and EDA
Summary : Use NTT stock price data to check basic statistics, detect trends and seasonality over time, and check for outliers.
Goal : Identify trends in data and extract answers for predictive modeling.
2.	Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
Overview : Perform preprocessing such as missing value handling, normalization, and scaling to create features that are useful for stock price prediction. Goal : Prepare data to improve model accuracy.
3.	Model Selection and Training
Overview : Select and implement a suitable predictive model. Examples could be ARIMA models, recurrent neural networks such as LSTM.
Goal : Build a model that can maximize the accuracy of stock price predictions. Note : There is no requirement for which model you build, but you should be prepared to explain why you chose the model you did.
4.	Evaluating the model and analyzing the results
Overview : Validate the model's predictive accuracy and calculate evaluation metrics.
Goal : To objectively evaluate the effectiveness of the model and analyze the results. Note : Please choose your own evaluation criteria, but be prepared to explain the reasons for your selection.
5.	Consider improvements and retrain the model
Summary : Find areas to improve your model and retrain it to reflect those improvements.
Goal : Build a more accurate predictive model.
Note : Please summarize in your presentation materials what hypothesis you used for your verification and what the results were.
6.	Summary of results and preparation of presentation materials
Summary : The results of the training will be compiled into materials, and the model building process and results will be reported in a presentation format.
Objective : Develop the skills to communicate technical results in an understandable way.
